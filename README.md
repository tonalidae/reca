# Measuring Dark Matter distribution on Milky way
This repository is product of summer internship lead by RECA, an effort of the Student Colombian Astronomy Network to bring research opportunities to undergraduate students.
This code was created to identify dar matter wake on MIlky Way dark matter halo, is based on numerical simulations using testing algorithms and Python was used to visualize data.
The main goal is to make the background for future observations of our galaxy by Vera Rubin Observatory.
